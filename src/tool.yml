      Apply SciKit-GStat variogram functions on a moving window over a data source
      The dataset has to be CSV with column names matching positions, or a 2D numpy array
      of shape (M, N), where M matches the length of positions and its order.
    parameters:
      positions:
        type: file
        description: | 
          Positions of the time series. The positions are considered static throughout the application
          of the moving window. In case a CSV is passed, it needs a 'x', ['y', 'z'] column. A remaining
          columns holds identifiers, or position names to match the positions to the data columns, in any
          other case the same order in both datasets is assumed.
          In case a .dat is passed, the positions will be aligned by order.
      data:
        type: file
        description: |
          Data series for each position. If a CSV is given, the column names need to match the column name
          column of the positions. Otherwise the oder of columns is used. In case a .dat is given, the first
          dimension has to match the length of positions and data is aligned by order to positions.
      variogram:
        type: struct
        description: | 
          Either a JSON or a struct object of variogram parameters, that should be static in each window.
          All remaining parameters will be derived for each window individually.
